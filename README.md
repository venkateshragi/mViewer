## Developer Notes

### Contribute to Imaginea / mViewer !
    1) Fork Imaginea / mViewer
    2) Clone your forked mViewer repository locally
    3) We use Intellij IDEA for development. So to setup with intellij 
       a) Create mViewer as a maven project using "Import project from external module".
       b) Apply Imaginea code styles/formatting settings to avoid un-wanted diffs with spaces in pull requests.
         - Download https://github.com/downloads/Imaginea/mViewer/settings.jar and use import settings option to apply it.
         - Make sure to format the code using ctr + alt + l before committing code.
         - When committing code, if see a popup regarding different line separators used in project, 
           then click 'Leave unchanged'.        
       c) Configure a Tomcat Server locally in intellij to run/debug mViewer.
    4) You can send a pull request to mViewer master branch with your features/enhancements/fixes.
          

### Making a Release build

 Using maven:-

> $mvn clean -Prelease

  Using ant:-  

> $ant release

 Building a release will generate mViewer-<version>-release.zip & mViewer-<version>-release.tar.gz files in the target folder
 which has the mViewer.war bundled with winstone servlet container and start-up scripts from scripts folder. 
   
### Running Standalone 
 
 Using maven:-
> $mvn -Pserver

 Using ant:-
> $ant start

It will create mViewer.war and run it using the winstone server. 
Once started, the application can be accessed at http://localhost:port. 
Default port is 8080 which can be updated in mViewer.properties file.

### Running Unit Tests

Use the following command to run the unit tests. surefire-reports will be generated in target folder.
> $mvn install -DskipTests=false

### Deploying to Other Servlet-Containers

You can generate a distributable war file using the following commands. The war can be deployed on to tomcat 7x. 
Other server integration will be provided on demand. 

Using maven:-
> $mvn clean package

Using ant:-
> $mvn dist

Once the war is deployed go to the url http://<server-ip>:<http-port>/mViewer
